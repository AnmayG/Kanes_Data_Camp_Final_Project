**R Markdown**

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

--

```{r cars}
# This is an example of a highlight
summary(cars) #<<
```

--

Now, moonreader will do your line breaks and everything for you, but it is not able to shrink text or do anything like that (at least to my knowledge).
It goes to the word just before the 80 character limit I believe, but your results may vary depending on the previous line of text.
You use a "---" header to start a new slide and a "--" header to create a new step, like how this text showed up.

---
**Including Plots**

You can also embed plots, for example:
--
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
--
  
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
